# Comparison-of-KNN-and-decision-tree-algorithms
In this Project I aimed to compare the accuracies of two classifiers I.E KNN  and Decision tree .

I have done the complete analysis of both the algorithms by calculating the Jaccard Score and F1-score of both the algorithms using a Loan Dataset taken from Kaggle.  
I have also done the Data Visualization of the dataset.  
These algorithms help to classify the customer on the basis of loan status i.e.,  
PAIDOFF and COLLECTION.  
We have done the model evaluation by taking a test set from Kaggle only.
